## Heart Disease Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

• Conducted in-depth analysis of a heart disease dataset using Python libraries (Pandas,
Seaborn, Matplotlib).

• Visualized data distributions and relationships with various plots: DistPlot for age
distribution, Pie Charts for categorical variables (gender), ViolinPlots for gender
comparison in heart disease prevalence, and correlation analysis using Heatmaps, Pair
Plots, and Joint Plots.

• Identified key trends and relationships such as age range (40-70) being most affected and
the gender disparity in heart disease risk (higher prevalence in males).

• Gained insights into variable interactions, which helped shape further statistical modeling
and hypothesis testing.
